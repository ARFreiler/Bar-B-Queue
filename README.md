## Future Development

There are several features we would still like to add to this application to allow more versatility. The ability to allow users to join and contribute to other scheduled events. The incorporation of food themed API's to allow users to research food dishes to bring to the event. Add the Google Map API to provide location details and directions to the event. Also would like to perform a majoe overhaul of the UX for a more asthetically pleasing and user friendly experience.
